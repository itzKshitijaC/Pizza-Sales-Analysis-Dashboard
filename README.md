# Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard üìä

# The business Problem üîç

### KPI's Requirements 

We need to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics

<b>1. Total Revenue: </b> The sum of the total price of all the pizza orders 

<b>2. Average order value: </b> The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders 

<b>3. Total Pizza Sold: </b> The sum of quantities of all the pizza sold 

<b>4. Total Orders: </b> The total number of orders placed

<b>5. Average pizza per order: </b> The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by total number of orders

# Data Preprocessing üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
1. Create a new column "order_day" from "order_date" column

           =TEXT([@[order_date]],"dddd")

2. Create a "total orders" column to count the total number of orders given by a particular customer

           =1/COUNTIF(B:B,[@[order_id]])
